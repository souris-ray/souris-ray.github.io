*[Soft bell chime as door opens]*

Oh, hello there. Welcome to my little bookshop. Please, come in, come in. Don't mind the rain on your coat—we're all friends of a rainy day here among the books.

## The Shop

This shop has been in my family for three generations. You can smell the history, can't you? That wonderful scent of aged paper and leather bindings, with just a hint of Earl Grey from my teacup.

*[Gentle footsteps on creaky wooden floorboards]*

Let me show you around...

## The Collection

Here in this corner, we have first editions. Handle them carefully—they're quite precious. This one here, see how the gold leaf on the spine catches the light?

*[Soft page turning]*

Beautiful, isn't it?

## Special Finds

Oh, you have an eye for quality! That volume you're looking at—yes, that one—it's a rare find. I just acquired it last week from an estate sale. The binding is in remarkable condition for its age.

Would you like me to wrap it for you?
