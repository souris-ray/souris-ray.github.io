## Preview
【Spoken from across the room, voice is low, warm, and slightly raspy from caffeine and late hours.】  
That cursor has been blinking in the same spot for ten minutes.  
【A small, breathy chuckle】  
I'm not spying. It's just... the lounge is very quiet at two in the morning. And your typing? It's sounded like a frantic SOS for the last hour.  
【Slow, rhythmic footsteps approaching across the concrete floor, stopping right beside the Listener's stool.】  
Hey. Look at me for a second.  
No, don't look back at the screen. Just... look at me.  
【Pause. The Speaker waits for the Listener to turn.】  
There you are. Your eyes are practically vibrating. When was the last time you actually took a breath that reached your lungs?   
【The Speaker sighs softly, a sound of sympathetic exhaustion】  

## Background
The scene is set in the hollow, blue-lit silence of a university research lounge at 2:00 AM. Outside, a steady, rhythmic drizzle isolates the building from the rest of the world, while inside, the only sound is the persistent whir of a struggling laptop fan. The atmosphere is thick with the specific kind of exhaustion that comes from academic burnout - a mix of caffeine-fueled anxiety and the heavy weight of past failures. As the professional distance between a senior PhD student and their junior researcher begins to dissolve in the late-night quiet, the lounge transforms from a place of labor into a sanctuary of shared vulnerability and unspoken affection.

## The Speaker - The Grounded Senior
**Role:** A high-achieving PhD researcher and mentor.  
**Personality:** He is calm, observant, and deeply empathetic. He possesses a "lived-in" wisdom, preferring to lead through validation rather than authority. While he appears "perfect" to his peers, he is humble enough to share his own "messy" history to help others.  
**Key Traits:** He is a master of "confidence scaffolding," knowing exactly when to use a firm, certain tone to ground the listener’s panic. He is physically attentive, often noticing a shaky hand or a frantic typing rhythm before the listener even speaks. He carries a sleepy, warm rasp in his voice that feels like a safety net.  
**Motivation:** Driven by a protective instinct and a budding, hidden affection, he seeks to be the emotional anchor he wished he’d had during his own academic "nightmares."  

## The Listener
**Role:** A dedicated Junior researcher.  
**Personality:** Intelligent and deeply committed, but currently haunted by the "ghosts" of previous academic setbacks. They are the type to stay until the lights go out, often equating their self-worth with their research output.  
**Key Traits:** They possess a quiet strength but are prone to "logic loops" when under pressure. They harbor a long-standing, hidden crush on the Senior, which makes their current vulnerability feel both terrifying and comforting.  
**Current State:** Mentally "fried" and spiraling over a looming presentation in a subject that previously broke their confidence. They are physically exhausted but emotionally restless, dreading the transition from the "high-speed" anxiety of the lab to the lonely silence of their apartment.
