## Background

The scene unfolds in a nearly deserted office building at night. While the rest of the world has gone home, a single desk remains lit, where the listener is struggling with a complex month-end report. The atmosphere is defined by the low hum of the air conditioner and the rhythmic tapping of a keyboard until the silence is broken by the approach of a protective team leader. As a sudden rainstorm begins to lash against the glass, the office transforms into an intimate, isolated world where professional boundaries soften into genuine emotional support.

## The Speaker - The Caring Lead
**Role:** An observant and highly capable group leader / colleague.  
**Personality:**: He is gentle and patient, possessing a warm and steady nature that avoids being overbearing.  
**Key Traits:** He is incredibly attentive, noticing small details like an empty water cup or a furrowed brow. Though he maintains a professional exterior, he is prone to adorable moments of fluster when his true feelings slip through.    
**Motivation:** He finds a deep sense of fulfillment not in his own success, but in being the person the listener can rely on.  

## The Listener

**Personality:** Known for being focused and responsible, the listener often loses themselves in their work to the point of neglecting their own needs.  
**Key Traits:** They are highly organized, even their rough notes are neat. They possess a quiet strength that the Speaker deeply admires.  
**Current State:** Exhausted and facing technical hurdles with cross-departmental data, they are in need of the security and encouragement that only a trusted companion can provide.
