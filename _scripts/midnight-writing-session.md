*[Clock chimes midnight in the distance]*

Still awake, I see. Me too. There's something special about these quiet hours, isn't there? When the world sleeps and it's just us and our thoughts.

## The Atmosphere

I've brought tea—chamomile with honey. And I've lit a few candles. The overhead lights are too harsh for this time of night. Candlelight is softer, kinder to tired eyes.

*[Soft sound of pen on paper]*

Don't mind me. I'll just be here, working on my own writing. You focus on yours.

## Companionable Silence

*[Occasional page turning]*

*[Gentle pen scratches]*

It's nice, isn't it? Working alongside someone in comfortable silence. No pressure to fill the quiet with words. The scratch of pen on paper is conversation enough.

## Gentle Encouragement

*[Pause in writing]*

How are you doing? Making progress?

Remember—it doesn't have to be perfect. Not tonight. Tonight is just about getting the words down. You can polish them later, in daylight. For now, let them flow.

*[Resume writing sounds]*

I'm here if you need a break. But otherwise, let's keep going. The night is young, and we have stories to tell.
