</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I add visuals to my recording?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">

### Live Streaming and Other Formats

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I perform the script on a live stream?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">

  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can my recording be used as a TikTok sound?</button>

  <button class="faq-question">Can I perform the script on a podcast?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Performing a script as part of a podcast episode (not your own channel) requires prior consultation. Please contact me via email.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Monetization

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I monetize my recording?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Yes. You may monetize on any platform that does not primarily host explicit content - this includes YouTube ads, Twitch streams, Patreon memberships, paid downloads, and similar. For any monetized content, you must include a link to this website. Sponsored content that features my script is not permitted.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I sell or monetize the script itself?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>No. The original script text and any PDF or document form of the script may not be sold, redistributed for payment, or monetized in any way. Only your original recording may be monetized.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I use the script for commercial projects?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Scripts may not be used for commercial projects beyond individual content creation (such as podcasts, apps, or audiobooks) without consulting me first. Please contact me via email to discuss.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Accessibility and Captions

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I add closed captions to my recording?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>Yes. You may add closed captions (synchronized within the video player, such as YouTube's CC feature). Captions may be clean verbatim - accurate to the spoken words with filler removed. You must still follow the standard crediting policy, including a link to this website.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I post a standalone transcript?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>No. Standalone transcripts - posted in the description, as a separate document, or anywhere outside the video player where text can be copied - are not permitted. This protects the script while still allowing accessibility through closed captions.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### What's Not Allowed

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I translate the script into another language?</button>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I use an AI voice to record the script?</button>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I add mature or explicit content?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Should I include age ratings?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>I may provide suggested age framing, but it is your responsibility as the voice actor to understand your audience and determine if additional age warnings are appropriate.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Series and Exclusivity

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">Can I request exclusive rights to a script?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>I am not currently taking commissions, so there are no exclusive recording rights available.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <button class="faq-question">If I record part one of a series, do I have priority for future parts?</button>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>No. You are free to record any parts of a series, and there is no expectation from me that you will continue. Other voice actors may also record any parts independently.</p>
  </div>
</div>
